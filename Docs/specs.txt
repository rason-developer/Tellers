   - Set up role-based access control.

3. **Real-time Collaborative Editing:**
   - Set up WebSocket (Socket.io) on the server and client.
   - Implement real-time text editor and handle changes broadcasting.

4. **Version Control:**
   - Create schema and routes for versioning.
   - Implement version tracking and rollback functionality.

5. **Categorization and Tagging:**
   - Create schema and routes for categories and tags.
   - Implement search and filter functionality.

6. **Commenting and Feedback:**
   - Create schema and routes for comments and ratings.
   - Implement feedback notification system.

7. **Notifications:**
   - Integrate email service (e.g., SendGrid) for notifications.
   - Set up notification triggers for story updates and comments.

8. **User Profile and Dashboard:**
